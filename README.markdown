#Welcome to Drawsomething_cheat
it just a very stupid app for testing my server

##deploy
    cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml

change your database information in this file,and then
   
    rake db:migrate

after database migration, run the script/insert_dic.rb, and i already put a dictionary text in this folder name **"hanying_done.txt"**,you could build your own dic too. the Draw model needs two properties : *english* and *chinese*,just mod that,and remmber to change thedatabase config in insert_dic.rb too

    cd script
    ruby insert_dic.rb

this apps requires **redis**, you could change your redis config in application.rb, i used $redis to be the global variable

and the last thing is the config/schedule.rb file, this is generated by whenever, for the visit count, run:
    whenever -i
